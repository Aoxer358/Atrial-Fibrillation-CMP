## Development 
### Branch naming convention: 
* feat:      Feature being added or expanded  
* bug:       Bug fix   
* junk:      Throwaway branch created for experimenting   
* *(any other commits; such as style changes, documentation, and minor text fixes, can be pushed straight onto the dev branch)* 
 
Once each branch is completed, merge it to the dev branch. Make sure the dev branch still works!
